## Installation

Movie Subtitles is an open-source Chrome Extension and can be downloaded from the Chrome Web Store.  
To install it please follow [this link](link-to-chrome-webstore), then click `install`.

## Adding Subtitles

Unfortunately, Movie Subtitles doesn't have a subtitle search.
You have to download the subtitles online before you can use them in the extension.
There are many websites that offer free subtitles. The most popular one is probably [Open Subtitles](https://opensubtitles.org). Another one is [Yify Subtitles](https://yts-subs.com).
Once you got the subtitles you're good to go!

> Note: Movie Subtitles supports subtitle files that end with `.txt`, `.srt`, or `.sub`. If your subtitles are inside a compressed archive/zip folder, you will have to extract/unzip them first.

## Subtitles Anywhere

Movie Subtitles works on almost all video/movie streaming platforms such as Amazon Prime, Disney Plus, Netflix (with some restrictions), Youtube, Vimeo, Twitch and many more!

Didn't catch a phrase? Listen to it again by clicking the arrow next to the subtitles.

- Style (adjust the subtitle size, background, and position)
- Over 40 supported languages (upload subtitles in almost any language you want)
- Skip Music (for this to work, choose subtitle files that indicate music with â™ª or [Music])
