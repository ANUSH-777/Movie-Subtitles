Do you love to watch movies but hate when there are too many long scenes between dialogues? Movie Subtitles let's you know whenever there is a long scene without speech, so you can skip right to the next dialogue.

## Installation

Movie Subtitles is an open-source Chrome Extension and can be downloaded from the Chrome Web Store.  
To install it please follow [this link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/movie-subtitles/ifimcneililngppkpddcliecbpcgdjag?hl=de), then click `install`.

## Adding Subtitles

Unfortunately, Movie Subtitles does not have a subtitle search.
You have to download the subtitles online before you can use them in the extension.
There are many websites that offer free subtitles. Two of the most popular ones are [Open Subtitles](https://opensubtitles.org) and [Yify Subtitles](https://yts-subs.com).
Once you've got the subtitles you're good to go!

> Note: Movie Subtitles supports `.txt`, `.srt`, and `.sub` files. If your subtitles are inside a compressed archive/zip folder, you will have to extract/unzip them first.

## Subtitles Anywhere

Movie Subtitles works on almost all video/movie streaming platforms such as Amazon Prime, Disney Plus, Netflix (with some restrictions), Youtube, Vimeo, Twitch and many more!

## Useful Features

Didn't catch a phrase? Listen to it again by clicking the arrow next to the subtitles.

> Note that Netflix restricts the functionality of browser extensions. For this reason, some shortcuts and functionalities are not available on Netflix!

## Other Useful Features

- Synchronization (let each sentence appear a little bit earlier/later)
- Style (adjust the subtitle size, background, and position)
- Over 40 supported languages (upload subtitles in almost any language you want)
- Skip Music (for this to work, choose subtitle files that indicate music with â™ª or [Music])
